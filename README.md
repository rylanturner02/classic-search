# Classic Web Search Chrome extension

I wrote this Chrome extension with the purpose of simplifying the Google Search experience, as the company continously adds bloat including auto-generated snippets and AI-enhanced answers to search queries.

My inspiration came from [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/themckenziest/status/1792630962108375118?t=DJv_-mjc6qO4xgtV4rwFJA) about users' disdains towards "knowledge panels" among other recent additions to Google Search.

The referenced article from [Tedium](https://tedium.co/2024/05/17/google-web-search-make-default/) is a great dive into workarounds for the aforementioned search bloat, however as the author notes, cusotmizing your default
search engine is exclusive to browsers like Vivaldi, and does not work seamlessly on Google Chrome. As such, I developed this browser extention to automatically redirect a search to the 'Web' filter, which only displays relevant
web results to a query.
